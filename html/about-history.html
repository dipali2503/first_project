                    <p>
                        Like many great institutions that rise to glory and power from humble circumstances, the Greater, Mumbai Police grew from modest seeding.The first police force in Bombay, marshalled by the East India Company, consisted of toddy tappers, men who came from
                        the Bhandari community.
                        <br>
                        <br> The history of the Bombay City Police opens in 1669 with the Bhandari Militia, a modest force of about 500 men. Bombay's seven separate islands were cemented by swamp. In 1661 this ignoble litter, recommended chiefly by its
                        plunging natural harbour, was given as dowry to King Charles Il of England as part of a politico-marital alliance with Catherine of Braganza. Bombay was to be the sweetener in an Anglo-Portuguese alliance to keep the Dutch and
                        French at bay in the East Indies; but as dowries go, it was hard to find one more malarial or unruly. Mosquitoes, robberies and burglaries were the order of the day.

                    <p>
                        Governor Gerald Aungier (1672-1677) felt that Bombay would be a better headquarters for the East India Company than Surat because of its trade advantages and natural harbour. <br>
                        <br>This transfer was eventually done in 1686.Aungier believed that Bombay was a city, which by God’s assistance is intended to be built and contributed greatly to its development. The city’s fortifications were strengthened, a
                        ditch was built around the fort, bastions and batteries were added, a marine base was established, the dockyard extended, <br>
                        <br>the garrison built up, the Forts at Sion and Sewree further fortified and a new fortress Fort St. George- was built in 1770.<br> English law and courts were introduced and judges appointed, a mole for berthing ships staked
                        out, a mint was established and the first rupee coined. Aungier also recommended the building of a walled town from Dongri in the north to Mendham’s Point, where today’s office of the Director General of Police, Maharashtra State.
                        <br> The Bombay Police was instrumental in conducting the first census operation, attempted by the Bombay Government in 1849. Captain E. Baynes, Superintendent of Police, was put in charge.

                    <h4 class="heading">Seven islands united through reclamation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Samual T. Sheppard, in his 1930 book Bombay described the city as the great epic of reclamation which has been in progress for two and a half centuries and of which the end is not yet in sight.
                        <br>
                        <br> The rise of Bombay can be attributed to the fusion of seven islands into one large island. The reclaiming of the land gave new spaces for development. The area between the seven islands, originally swampy land called ‘flats’,
                        today forms much of central Mumbai. But during high tide these areas are completely submerge, making the islands inaccessible to one another. Coconut palms grew in these flats and local inhabitants would add fish manure to it;
                        and dry leaves further made the swamps dirty.
                        <br>
                        <br> One of the major reclamations of this period was the building of the Hornby Vellard ( the area facing Haji Ali). This altered the island most remarkably. Charles Boone began the work in 1715, and a temporary reclamation of
                        the great breach at Mahalakshmi, which separated Bombay island from Worli, was built. But the actual construction of the Vellard (from the Portuguese Vellodo, meaning fence) took place between 1771 and 1784 under Governor William
                        Hornby.
                        <br>
                        <br> his Vellard made the crucial connection between north and south Bombay, opening up lands in central areas of the flats for settlement and cultivation. It also linked the eastern and western sides of the island.In 1805 the
                        Sion causeway, connecting it to the mainland, was built. And with the completion of Coloba causeway in 1838, all the seven islands were linked together.

                        Superintendent of Police, Bombay/ Deputy Commissioner of Police / Acting Commissioner of Police (1855-1863)
                        <br>
                        <br> Easily the most maverick police chief Bombay has ever had, Charles Forjett, like a modern-day Emperor Akbar, walked the streets in disguise to listen in on people's conversations and sniff out possible mutinies. Brought up
                        in India, he had an intimate knowledge of local customs and a flair for the language. His physical features helped him; S. M. Edwards ICS, Commissioner of Police, Bombay (1909-1916) describes him as having "black hair and a sallow
                        complexion". It was during his tenure as police chief that the 1857 revolution erupted, shaking the East India Company to its very foundations. But while there was butchery and bloodshed in northern India and Bengal, Forjett kept
                        Bombay quiet. Perhaps this was also because of the city's inherent commercial instinct to eschew political trouble but Forjett also let it be known that not even a whisper of dissent would be tolerated. And he broadcast his message
                        in the most macabre way possible.
                        <br>
                        <br> Claiming to have uncovered an Indian Guy Fawkes conspiracy to blow up the town during Diwali, Forjett had the two ring-leaders arrested, stripped and tied to two canons. On October 15, 1857, the two men, Drill Havaldar Sayed
                        Hussain of the Marine Battalion and sepoy Mangal Guddrea of the 10th Native Indian Regiment, were blown to smithereens at the Esplanade in front of packed crowds. Ironically, this very Esplanade was renamed Azad Maidan. Despite
                        his iron fist, Forjett was admired by the Indians for his high standard of policing. He introduced beats, night rounds and other procedures. If he found his officers misbehaving with the locals or taking bribes he came down hard
                        on them. What really set him apart in the eyes of the Indian was his exoneration of Jagannath Shankarseth, a leading businessman and philanthropist, falsely accused of treason by Europeans with vested interests.

                        prompted the Bombay Government to mobilise all its resources to avert a water crisis. Crowford was put in charge of all the public tanks and wells on the island to prevent wastage of water. He served as Commissioner of Police till

                        On December 14,1864 a dashing 33-year-old officer named Frank Henry Souter was appointed the Commissioner of Police who still holds the record of the longest tenure as Commissioner of Police, a full 24 years; but more importantly he is known for setting
                        the standards for policing in a rapidly expanding city. The lack of adequate housing and sanitation for his men was a constant cause for concern. Souter was chosen for the position because of the distinguished service rendered
                        by him in suppressing mutinies in the southern Maratha region and Dharwar. To the British, still trembling after the ferocity of the Indian uprising of 1857, men like Charles Forjett and Frank Souter were the new heroes.

                        In 1939, the Prohibition Branch opened. One of its main operations was searching carriers and vendors of liquor, and many of them were women who were used as fronts. It was impossible to have nurses present all over the city and the need for full-time
                        women searchers was keenly felt. As a result, 22 lady 'Searchers’ were appointed in the X Division (Prohibition Division) at a salary of Rs 25 per month plus free housing.The experiment was successful and the post of Women Constable
                        was created. Those were also the war years and the burden thrown on the police had increased manifold, so the extra hands were welcomed.
                        <br>
                        <br> It was A. E. Caffin, the last British CP, who first wrote to the government expressing the need for women police officers, but he left before anything could be done about it.

                        They didn’t lift a finger even when they were pelted with chappals. The reason: It was an all-woman morcha. The scene had Its desired effect on the IG: He went ahead and recruited a few strapping women and had them trained.
